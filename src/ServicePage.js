                  Founded in 1997, Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) is a non-profit
                  501(c)3 that organizes the low-wage Pilipinx community in
                  Southern California to demand better living and working
                  conditions. In this current national and political climate
                  where immigrant rights are being attacked and quickly eroded,
                  domestic workers are pushed even more into vulnerable and
                  exploitative working situations. PWC does their part by
                  providing support for human trafficking survivors, immigration
                  services, affordable housing, workforce training, education on
                  workersâ€™ rights, wage theft enforcement, free tax preparation,
                  and a cooperative for homecare workers.

                The Red Whistle is a collaborative platform for people and organizations to come together and show their support for those living with HIV. It is an agent for change and a partner for brands, celebrities, and influencers to get educated on HIV and participate in activities that aim to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination.

As HIV advocates, The Red Whistle aims to empower and inspire people to come together and help each other in our commitment to promote HIV awareness and sex positivity. Using art, social media, and pop culture as tools to change people's mindsets, we hope to start discussions among young people so that they understand the issues underlying the rise of new HIV infections. Let's blow the whistle harder, sound the alarm that HIV is here so that it can be stopped.
